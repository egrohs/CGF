# TabletopGDX - A LibGDX Framework for Board Games

TabletopGDX is a powerful framework built on top of LibGDX specifically designed to accelerate the development of digital board games. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, abstractions, and systems that handle common board game mechanics, allowing developers to focus on game-specific logic rather than low-level implementation details.

## 🎯 Features
- Flexible Turn Management: Support for multiple turn strategies (Standard, Auction, Stat-based, Time Track, and more).
- Visual Abstractions: Pre-built components for boards, tiles, pieces, and game UI elements.
- Rule System: Modular rule engine for validating game actions and moves.
- Event System: Decoupled communication between game components.
- Network Support: Built-in multiplayer capabilities with serialization.
- Save/Load System: Automatic game state persistence.
- Debug Tools: Development utilities for faster iteration.
- Customizable: Easily extendable to fit any board game genre.
